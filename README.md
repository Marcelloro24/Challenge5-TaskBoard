## Description

This project is a Task Board application built using Third-Party APIs. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks in a kanban-style board. The application leverages jQuery for DOM manipulation and dayjs for date handling. Users can add new tasks, move them between different status columns, and delete completed tasks. The Task Board also features a date display and local storage functionality to persist tasks between sessions.
